A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Installation

Download the Flutter SDK from [Get Started](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
and unzip it into the desired location (not in a directory with elevated privileges like "C:\Program Files\")

Update the path environment variable like [this](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#update-your-path)

Run `flutter doctor` in your terminal. Here you can check which steps you have to take

Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), then launch it

Go to "more actions" -> SDK manager.
Make sure you have checked those elements like here (if not check and install them):

Go to "more actions" -> AVD manager. Create a new virtual device. At step 2 you have to download the Android version 11.

At the end you have to run the following command:

```
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

Say yes to all of them.

To make sure everything is working, run `flutter doctor` again.
